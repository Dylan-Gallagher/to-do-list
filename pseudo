What you need:
A container (array) of all the to-dos.
An imput box to enter the to-do.
An unordered list to show the to-dos.



We have an input box with a "submit" button to the side of it.'
Under the input box have a unordered list: This will show the user's to-dos.

Initialize an array called 'list',
    This will hold all of the user's to-dos
When the user clicks submit (button.onClick), run a function that adds the text to the array ("list")

Make a function that is activated on the click of the submit button
    This adds the element of the array to the unordered list.
